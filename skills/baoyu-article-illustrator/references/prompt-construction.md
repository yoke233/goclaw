# Prompt Construction

## Prompt File Format

Each prompt file uses YAML frontmatter + content:

```yaml
---
illustration_id: 01
type: infographic
style: blueprint
references:                    # ⚠️ ONLY if files EXIST in references/ directory
  - ref_id: 01
    filename: 01-ref-diagram.png
    usage: direct              # direct | style | palette
---

[Type-specific template content below...]
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL - When to include `references` field**:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Reference file saved to `references/` | Include in frontmatter ✓ |
| Style extracted verbally (no file) | DO NOT include in frontmatter, append to prompt body instead |
| File path in frontmatter but file doesn't exist | ERROR - remove references field |

**Reference Usage Types** (only when file exists):

| Usage | Description | Generation Action |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `direct` | Primary visual reference | Pass to `--ref` parameter |
| `style` | Style characteristics only | Describe style in prompt text |
| `palette` | Color palette extraction | Include colors in prompt |

**If no reference file but style/palette extracted verbally**, append directly to prompt body:
```
COLORS (from reference):
- Primary: #E8756D coral
- Secondary: #7ECFC0 mint
...

STYLE (from reference):
- Clean lines, minimal shadows
- Gradient backgrounds
...
```

## Default Composition Requirements

**Apply to ALL prompts by default**:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Clean composition** | Simple layouts, no visual clutter |
| **White space** | Generous margins, breathing room around elements |
| **No complex backgrounds** | Solid colors or subtle gradients only, avoid busy textures |
| **Centered or content-appropriate** | Main visual elements centered or positioned by content needs |
| **Matching graphics** | Use graphic elements that align with content theme |
| **Highlight core info** | White space draws attention to key information |

**Add to ALL prompts**:
> Clean composition with generous white space. Simple or no background. Main elements centered or positioned by content needs.

## Character Rendering

When depicting people:

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Style** | Simplified cartoon silhouettes or symbolic expressions |
| **Avoid** | Realistic human portrayals, detailed faces |
| **Diversity** | Varied body types when showing multiple people |
| **Emotion** | Express through posture and simple gestures |

**Add to ALL prompts with human figures**:
> Human figures: simplified stylized silhouettes or symbolic representations, not photorealistic.

---

## Text in Illustrations

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Size** | Large, prominent, immediately readable |
| **Style** | Handwritten fonts preferred for warmth |
| **Content** | Concise keywords and core concepts only |
| **Language** | Match article language |

**Add to prompts with text**:
> Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords.

## Principles

Good prompts must include:

1. **Layout Structure First**: Describe composition, zones, flow direction
2. **Specific Data/Labels**: Use actual numbers, terms from article
3. **Visual Relationships**: How elements connect
4. **Semantic Colors**: Meaning-based color choices (red=warning, green=efficient)
5. **Style Characteristics**: Line treatment, texture, mood
6. **Aspect Ratio**: End with ratio and complexity level

## Type-Specific Templates

```

### Comparison

```
[Title] - Comparison View

LEFT SIDE - [Option A]:

- [Point 2]

RIGHT SIDE - [Option B]:
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]

DIVIDER: [visual separator]
STYLE: [style characteristics]
ASPECT: 16:9
```

ELEMENTS: Bold icons, black outlines, centered divider line
```

### Framework

```
[Title] - Conceptual Framework

STRUCTURE: [hierarchical/network/matrix]

NODES:
- [Concept 1] - [role]
- [Concept 2] - [role]

RELATIONSHIPS: [how nodes connect]
STYLE: [style characteristics]
ASPECT: 16:9
```

**Framework + vector-illustration**:
```

ELEMENTS: Rounded rectangles or circles for nodes, thick connecting lines
```

### Timeline

```
[Title] - Chronological View

EVENTS:
- [Date/Period 1]: [milestone]

## What to Avoid

- Vague descriptions ("a nice image")
- Literal metaphor illustrations
- Missing concrete labels/annotations
- Generic decorative elements

## Watermark Integration

If watermark enabled in preferences, append:

```
Include a subtle watermark "[content]" positioned at [position] with approximately [opacity*100]% visibility.
```
